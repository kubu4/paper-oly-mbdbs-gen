### 2bRAD

Files that can be used as relatedness matrix for MACAU: HSmbdsamples_rab.txt and mbdsamples_rab.txt. File starting with HS is generated from an ANGSD run using only HC/SS samples, the other is a run using HC/SS/NF samples. The two files are very tightly correlated so should not matter much.
